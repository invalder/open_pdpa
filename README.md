3. **API Design**: Complete API specification before implementation
4. **Implementation**: Code development based on approved specifications
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing against specifications
6. **Deployment**: Production deployment with compliance validation

## Documentation Standards

All project documents follow strict change management:
- Every file includes a change log section
- Version control for all specifications
- Approval workflows for specification changes
- Traceability from requirements to implementation
